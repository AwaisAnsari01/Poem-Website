        You are proud as a master poet,</br>
Poetic soul with rhythmical intellect,</br>
Verse and prose comes from you imaginative wit,</br>
Be laud with a prolific languages steal our spirit.</br>
    </br>
    </br>

One sadden moment I read your poetry,</br>
Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,</br>
What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.</br>
Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,</br>
</br>
</br>
A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,</br>
Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,</br>
Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,</br>
Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.</br>
</br>
</br>
Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,</br>
Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,</br>
Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,</br>
Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.
